        <ul>
            <li>45 trillion gallons of water. (Enough water to fill 70 million olympic sized swimming pools) </li> 
            <li>350 million barrels of oil. (The same amount of water as the United States currently has in its reserves)</li>
            <li>3.4 million acres of land.(About the size of the United States, India, and Colombia combined) </li>
            
            <li>170 million metric tons of GHG in the decomposition of food alone.
            (Which is roughly equivalent to 20 billion gallons of gasoline)</li>
            
            <li>1.3 billion tons of food. 
            (Enough food to feed all  the hungry and malnoursihed people in the world) </li>

        <p> One way to lower food waste is to collect food from restaurants or supermarkets that throw stuff away after each day. This is done by companies such as City Harvest or Dreaming Out Loud. More companies can be found <a href="https://foodtank.com/news/2020/12/organizations-diverting-food-waste-to-provide-meals-for-people-in-need/"> here.</a> </p>

        </div>
           <!-- PUT INFO AND IMAGES FOR SECTION 2 BELOW HERE -->
        <p> Another way is to plan out what you are going to buy each week using <a href="https://www.myplate.gov/tip-sheet/meal-planning">MyPlate</a> to make healthy meals. By only buying what you need, one saves on wasted food. One can also learn to compost through websites like <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home">this one.</a> This way any food that isn't eaten from banana peels to egg shells can be reused to help lower food waste</p>
